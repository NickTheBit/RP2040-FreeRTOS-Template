#  RP2040-FreeRTOS-Template
This is a template meant to be used as a starting point for 
the RP2040s SDK. It is meant to implement a project skeleton along
with some hardware abstraction.

> This is a work in progress, so major changes are expected.

## Installation prerequisites
* This project requires that the pico SDK is installed and available
on the system path. 
* Make sure the project is cloned recursively with all of it's submodules.
  For the moment this is just the FreeRTOS kernel, but the project will be divided into smaller parts in the future.

## Installation instructions
None, there will be some if the project is deemed usable.
